## Email Template for Data Access Request

**Subject:** Research Collaboration Request - Latin Bibliography Project

**Dear USTC Team,**

I am a researcher working on a comprehensive Latin bibliography project (1450-1900) and would like to request access to USTC data for academic research purposes.

### Project Overview
- **Research Focus**: Comprehensive deduplicated bibliography of Latin printed works
- **Time Period**: 1450-1900 (with emphasis on 1450-1700 USTC coverage)
- **Output**: Research-grade CSV file for scholarly analysis
- **Institution**: [Your Institution/Independent Researcher]
- **Academic Affiliation**: [If applicable]

### Specific Requirements
- **Records Needed**: Latin-language works only (~500,000 estimated records)
- **Fields Required**: Title, author, publication year/place, library holdings
- **Format Options**: CSV, JSON, MARC XML (flexible)
- **Usage**: Non-commercial academic research only
- **Citation**: Will properly cite USTC as data source

### Technical Options
I'm prepared to discuss multiple approaches:
1. **Direct database export** (preferred)
2. **OAI-PMH harvesting** (if available)
3. **Structured data dumps**
4. **API access** (with proper rate limiting)
5. **Research collaboration agreement**

### Commitments
- **Data will be used for non-commercial academic research only**
- **Results will be publicly available with proper attribution**
- **Methodology and findings will be shared with USTC team**
- **Willing to collaborate on data quality improvement**
- **Will respect all licensing restrictions**

### Research Value
This project will create a valuable research resource that:
- Enhances accessibility of Latin bibliography data
- Provides cross-catalogue deduplication research
- Supports digital humanities scholarship
- May contribute valuable data cleaning insights back to USTC

**Would you be available for a brief discussion about potential collaboration options?**

Thank you for your time and consideration.

**Best regards,**
