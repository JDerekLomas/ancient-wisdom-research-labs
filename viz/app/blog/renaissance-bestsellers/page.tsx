        Some Latin books went through 100+ editions between 1450 and 1700. They were the
        most widely-read texts of their era. Today, they&apos;re completely inaccessible to
        most readers.
      </p>

      <h2>Measuring &ldquo;Importance&rdquo;</h2>

      <p>
        How do you identify which historical texts mattered? One proxy: how many times were
        they reprinted? Books that went through dozens of editions were clearly in demand.
        Printers wouldn&apos;t keep reprinting works nobody bought.
      </p>

      <p>
        We analyzed the USTC data to find Latin works with 20 or more recorded editions—the
        &ldquo;bestsellers&rdquo; of Renaissance publishing. Then we filtered out classical authors
        (Cicero, Virgil) and well-known figures with substantial modern translations (Erasmus,
        Aquinas).
      </p>

      <p>
        What remains is a list of works that shaped European culture for centuries—and are
        now almost entirely forgotten.

      <h2>What Were These Books?</h2>

      <h3 style={{ color: '#9e4a3a' }}>Donatus, Ars minor (364 editions)</h3>
      <p>
        <em>The</em> Latin grammar textbook. For over a thousand years, from late antiquity
        through the Renaissance, this was how you learned Latin. The word &ldquo;donat&rdquo; or
        &ldquo;donet&rdquo; became synonymous with &ldquo;grammar book&rdquo; in several European languages.
        364 editions in our period alone—and yet there&apos;s no modern English translation
        readily available. The foundational text of Latin education is itself inaccessible.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ color: '#9e4a3a' }}>Alexander de Villa Dei, Doctrinale (139 editions)</h3>
      <p>
        A versified Latin grammar from the 13th century that remained the standard textbook
        for 300 years. Schoolboys across Europe memorized its 2,645 hexameter lines. It was
        eventually displaced by humanist grammars—but understanding medieval and early modern
        education requires knowing what students actually learned. No complete English translation
        exists.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ color: '#9e4a3a' }}>Guido de Monte Rocherii, Manipulus curatorum (119 editions)</h3>
      <p>
        A practical handbook for parish priests, covering how to administer the sacraments,
        hear confessions, and perform pastoral duties. This was the actual working manual
        for thousands of clergy across Europe. It documents what the Church <em>actually
        practiced</em> versus what theologians theorized. Untranslated.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ color: '#9e4a3a' }}>Andrés de Escobar, Modus confitendi (106 editions)</h3>
      <p>
        A confession guide that taught both priests and laypeople how to examine their
        consciences and confess their sins. These texts shaped how millions of people
        understood morality, guilt, and repentance. They&apos;re essential sources for
        understanding religious psychology—and almost none are translated.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ color: '#9e4a3a' }}>Cesare Baronio, Annales Ecclesiastici (63 editions)</h3>
      <p>
        A massive church history written to counter the Protestant <em>Magdeburg Centuries</em>.
        Baronio&apos;s 12-volume work became the authoritative Catholic account of church history
        and remained influential for centuries. It&apos;s constantly cited in scholarship—and
        there&apos;s no English translation.
      </p>

      <h2>Bestsellers by Subject</h2>

      <p>
        The pattern of untranslated bestsellers varies dramatically by field:

        border: '1px solid #e0d8c8',
        borderRadius: '8px',

        margin: '32px 0',
      }}>
        <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', gap: '20px' }}>
          {[
            { label: "Religious texts", stats: "196 bestsellers, 186 untranslated", percent: 95, color: '#9e4a3a' },
            { label: "University publications", stats: "90 bestsellers, 88 untranslated", percent: 98, color: '#9e4a3a' },

          ].map(({ label, stats, percent, color }) => (
            <div key={label}>
              <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between', marginBottom: '6px', fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif', fontSize: '14px' }}>
                <span style={{ color: '#1a1612' }}>{label}</span>
                <span style={{ color: '#666' }}>{stats}</span>
              </div>
              <div style={{ width: '100%', background: '#e0d8c8', borderRadius: '999px', height: '8px', overflow: 'hidden' }}>
                <div style={{ background: color, height: '8px', borderRadius: '999px', width: `${percent}%` }}></div>
              </div>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Classical authors—Cicero, Virgil, Ovid—have been translated repeatedly. That&apos;s
        the ~33% &ldquo;success story.&rdquo; But religious texts, legal commentaries, and university
        publications have translation rates approaching zero.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Does This Matter?</h2>

      <p>
        These weren&apos;t obscure works. They were the most widely-read texts of their era.
        The fact that they went through 50, 100, or 300+ editions means they were constantly
        in demand, constantly being used, constantly shaping how people thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we study the Renaissance without access to these texts, we&apos;re like historians
        of the 20th century who can only read Time magazine but not textbooks, technical
        manuals, or religious publications. We get the famous names and the intellectual
        highlights—but miss the actual texture of how people learned, worked, and believed.
      </p>

      <p>
        The good news: many of these bestsellers are digitized. The scans exist. What&apos;s
        missing is the layer that makes them accessible—transcription, translation, and
        context. That&apos;s a solvable problem.
